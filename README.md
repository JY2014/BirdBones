# Bird Bones and Living Habits

This data analysis project uses a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zhangjuefei/birds-bones-and-living-habits) that contains bone measures and living habits of birds provided by Dr. D. Liu of Beijing Museum of Natural History. The data contains ecological categories of the birds and measures of length and diameter of five bones from the bird's skeleton. The analysis explores the data and builds models to classify the bird's ecological classes based on the bone information. 

The final classification with high accuracy indicates that the bird's living habits are related to its bone structure. It makes sense because a bird's living habits are the results of the natual selection and evolution of the bird's body structures. The different bone structures enable the birds to adapt to the different living habits. Besides performaing classification using the bone measures, details of the bone structures may also help the studies of how birds adapt to the different living habits.
